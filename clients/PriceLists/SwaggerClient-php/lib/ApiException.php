/**
 * Price Lists
 *
 * Populate different versions of catalog pricing and assign them to different [customer groups](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api) at the variant level.  - [Authentication](#authentication) - [Price Lists](#price-lists) - [Price list assignments](#price-list-assignments) - [Usage notes](#usage-notes) - [Additional information](#additional-information)  ## Authentication  Authenticate requests by including an [OAuth](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication) `access_token` and `client_id` in the request headers.  ```http GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/{{ENDPOINT}} Content-Type: application/json X-Auth-Client: {{CLIENT_ID}} X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}} ```  ### OAuth Scopes  | UI Name                                      | Permission | Parameter                                     | |----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------| | Products                                     | modify     | `store_v2_products`                           | | Products                                     | read-only  | `store_v2_products_read_only`                 |  ## Price Lists  The association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be done either via the Control Panel or using the [Customer Groups API.](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api)  Additionally, [Price List Assignments](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/price-lists/price-lists-records/) can be created to assign Price Lists to a specific [Channel](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/channels-listings-api). Price lists assigned to a channel apply to all shoppers on that channel, unless there is a more specific assignment.  If an active Price List does not contain prices for a variant then the Catalog pricing will be used. The association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be done either via the Control Panel or using the [Customer Groups API.](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api)  Price Lists will provide overridden price values to the Stencil storefront. Final price display can be further customized within the Stencil template. See the [Price Object](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/price-object-properties) in Stencil for further documentation.  To learn more about Price Lists, see [here](/api-docs/price-lists/price-list-overview).  ## Price list assignments  ### Order of operations  The `Price List Assignment` Pricing Order of Operations is as follows:  **IF** `Price list` assigned to current `Customer Group` **AND** `Price List` assigned to current `Channel`: * Use this Price List -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)  **ELSE IF**: `Price List` assigned to current `Channel`: * Use this price list -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)  **ELSE IF** `Price List` assigned to current `Customer Group`: * Use this price list -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)  **ELSE IF** `Customer Group Discounts`: * Use them -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)  **ELSE IF** `channel` has a `default price list`: * Use this price list -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)  **ELSE**: * Fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)  **Note:** Price Lists cannot be assigned to a customer group that has custom group discounts -- the customer group discounts must be deleted first.  ## Usage notes - Price Lists cannot be assigned to a customer group that has custom group discounts -- the customer group discounts must be deleted first. - Bulk pricing Tiers may additionally be associated with a price record to indicate different pricing as the quantity in cart increases. - If a variant has a `Price Record` any existing product-level bulk pricing will not apply in the cart. For variants without `Price Records`, any existing product bulk pricing will apply. - Price Lists Records accepts bulk upsert. Only one [Bulk upsert](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/catalog/pricelists-api/price-lists-records/setpricelistrecordcollection) can done at a time. Running more than one in parallel on the **same store** will cause a 429 error and the request will fail. - There are no direct webhooks available for Price Lists. Since Price Lists directly relate to products, webhooks related to products will fire for corresponding changes such as pricing.  ## Additional information  ### Webhooks  * [Products](/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/webhook-events#webhook-events_products) * [SKU](/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/webhook-events#webhook-events_sku)  ### Related endpoints * [Get Price List Collection](/api-reference/catalog/pricelists-api/price-lists/getpricelistcollection)
