Refund up to the entire order amount to store credit. 2. Mark an amount up to the full order amount as refunded externally, through a provider or means not represented directly in BC (\&quot;custom\&quot;). 3. Refund the amount paid by store credit to store credit, and the amount paid by bank deposit via a manual refund, which will be recorded as being refunded against the bank deposit.    &gt; | [optional]
